# Chat-App

A custom, decentralised chat app that does not store any data and is mostly an experiment I had with websockets, but I utilise for brief conversations with someone I may need to have, quickly and easily.

Some frontend changes need to be made before this is in working order and is usable on mobile.
Need to learn some more frontend :)
