# Chat-App

A custom, decentralised chat app that does not store any data and is mostly an experiment I had with websockets, but I utilise for brief conversations with someone I may need to have, quickly and easily.

Some frontend changes need to be made before this is in working order and is usable on mobile.
Need to learn some more frontend :)

# Installation & Usage

If you want to pain yourselves and run it...
```zsh
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Zidaan-Hayat/chat-app.git

# Move to directory
cd chat-app/

# Install packages
npm i

# Run app
node .
```
_By default the app runs on port 8080, you can change this on line 23 of the `index.js` file._
